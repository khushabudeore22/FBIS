            Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications. 
            It involves various technologies such as HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript 
            for interactivity. A well-designed webpage focuses not only on functionality but also on 
            readability and user experience. Proper text alignment, adequate line spacing, and balanced 
            letter spacing make long content easier to read and visually appealing. When users can read 
            content comfortably, they are more likely to stay on the website and engage with the information 
            provided. Therefore, applying correct CSS properties plays a crucial role in building 
            professional and user-friendly web interfaces.
